# Employee Salary Prediction using KNN

## 🔍 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual's salary exceeds a certain threshold based on demographic features such as age, education, occupation, and more. This classification problem is based on the Adult Census Income dataset and aims to assist in understanding how socioeconomic factors influence income levels.

## ⚙️ System Approach
**System Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries Used:**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧠 Algorithm & Deployment
1. Data collection from Adult CSV dataset.
2. Data preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding).
3. Train-test split.
4. Apply KNN classification.
5. Evaluate model using metrics.
6. Visualize accuracy and confusion matrix.
7. Export results.

## 📊 Results

## ✅ Conclusion
The KNN model showed decent performance on classifying salary levels. Some challenges included imbalance in the dataset and optimizing the number of neighbors.

## 🔭 Future Scope
- Compare with other ML algorithms like Decision Trees, SVM, or Random Forest.
- Tune hyperparameters further.
- Integrate into a web application using Flask.
